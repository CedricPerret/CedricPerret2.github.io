## Equality, hierarchy, oligarchy: Model-driven investigation of the evolutionary origins of social organization  

My PhD investigates the evolutionary origins of hierarchy, leadership and despotism in human groups. On one side, hierarchy seem imposed by leaders for their own advantage. On the other side, hierarchy appears to be a group adaptation to organize at low cost. We propose that hierarchy and its two ambiguous group effects both emerge from the evolution of individual capacities to influence. To understand the mechanisms involved, we simulate evolution of human populations and explicitly describe how individual influence affects collective decision-making. Such bottom-up approach aims to provide mechanistic explanation for the origin of hierarchy and deeper insights into its effects on human evolution. 
Ultimately, this work contributes to (i) understand the evolution of human societies and (ii) to design efficient artificial societies.
