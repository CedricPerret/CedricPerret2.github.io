I am a 3rd year PhD student in the Centre of Algorithms, Visualisation and Evolving Systems at Edinburgh Napier University under the supervision of [Simon Powers](https://www.napier.ac.uk/people/simon-powers) and [Emma Hart](https://www.napier.ac.uk/people/emma-hart). 

My research interests lie in the evolution of social behaviour (cooperation, coordination) and social organization (hierarchy, institutions).
