I am a 3rd year PhD student in evolutionary dynamics and social evolution at Edinburgh Napier University under the supervision of [Simon Powers](https://www.napier.ac.uk/people/simon-powers) and [Emma Hart](https://www.napier.ac.uk/people/emma-hart). 

My research interests lie in the evolution of social behaviour (cooperation, coordination) and social organization (hierarchy, institutions). In particular, I aim to investigate *how mechanisms to maintain cooperation and coordination have changed during the transition from small human groups to large societies of unrelated individuals?*

On a broader spectrum, my research interests lie in (i) evolution at different levels (genes, individuals, groups) and (ii) the interaction between different dynamics, e.g. ecology and evolution, cultural and biological evolution. 

To investigate these topics, I use models ranging from analytical models, i.e. adaptive dynamics and game theory, through to numerical simulations, i.e. individualâ€“centered models and opinion formation models.

### Academic background
I am a PhD student at Edinburgh Napier University since 2016. I obtained my master degree in Ecology and Evolutionary Biology at the University of Montpellier in 2016. I also had the chance to participate to the Santa Fe Summer school on Complex systems in 2018.
