I am a post-doctoral research associate in evolutionary dynamics and social evolution at Exeter University in the Currie lab. 

My research interests lie in the evolution of social behaviour (cooperation, coordination) and social organization (hierarchy, institutions). Of particular relevance to my work is the question of *how mechanisms to maintain cooperation and coordination have changed during the transition from small human groups to large societies of unrelated individuals?*

My current projects investigate (i) the emergence of state in Japan and (ii) the interactions between hierarchy and institutions. 

To investigate these topics, I use models ranging from analytical models, i.e. adaptive dynamics and game theory, through to numerical simulations, i.e. individualâ€“centered models and opinion formation models.

On a broader spectrum, I am interested by a range of topics including the evolution of cancer, cultural evolution, multilevel/kin selection, social interactions between human and machines, and complex systems so feel free to contact me!

### Academic background
I obtained my master degree in Ecology and Evolutionary Biology at the University of Montpellier in 2016. I did a PhD at Edinburgh Napier University under the supervision of [Simon Powers](https://www.napier.ac.uk/people/simon-powers) and [Emma Hart](https://www.napier.ac.uk/people/emma-hart) from 2016 to 2019. Then, I was a post-doctoral research associate in evolutionary dynamics and social evolution at Teeside University. I also had the chance to participate to the Santa Fe Summer school on Complex systems in 2018.
